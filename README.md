This is a generalized package for tools I find useful in R package development

I will likely add to this repo over time, and split it out into seperate packages if there are enough related functions

## Installation 

```R
#development version from GitHub:
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("zac-garland/zgtools")
```
